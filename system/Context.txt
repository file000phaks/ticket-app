Constraints:

Server = Express, isolated from frontend.

Replace JSON storage with a pluggable DB adapter behind /lib/dbHelpers.ts.

Auth behind /lib/authHelpers.ts with JWT (access + refresh), Argon2 for hashing, rotation, and env-driven secrets.

Frontend communicates only via hooks (useTickets, useNotifications, etc.) and an /lib/apiClient.ts.

No component imports server code.

All backend changes happen behind dbHelpers.ts and authHelpers.ts so we can swap databases/providers with zero frontend changes.
